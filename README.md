# Enhancing Public and Student Understanding of Urban Energy Resilience Through Experiential Climate Education Programs

## Overview
This repository hosts the implementation and research findings of the study **"Enhancing Public and Student Understanding of Urban Energy Resilience Through Experiential Climate Education Programs"**. The project aims to enhance **urban energy resilience** in response to rapid urbanization, climate change, and increasing disruptions such as extreme weather, cyber-attacks, and resource limitations.

## Abstract
Traditional urban energy management approaches often struggle to address the **interconnected and adaptive** nature of energy systems, leading to vulnerabilities in resilience under dynamic conditions. To overcome these challenges, we propose:

- **Resilience-Aware Urban Energy Framework (RAUEF):** A comprehensive framework that integrates resilience metrics into energy system optimization. By leveraging **network theory** and **stochastic modeling**, RAUEF enables robust simulations and mitigation strategies for urban energy disruptions.
- **Dynamic Adaptive Energy Resilience Strategy (DAERS):** A real-time operational strategy that employs **predictive analytics, scenario-based planning, and adaptive control mechanisms** to dynamically respond to disruptions.

Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our methodology, showing substantial improvements in **resilience metrics, recovery efficiency, and adaptability** across diverse urban scenarios. This framework bridges the gap between **theoretical models and real-world applications**, offering a **scalable, interdisciplinary solution** to urban energy resilience.

## Features
